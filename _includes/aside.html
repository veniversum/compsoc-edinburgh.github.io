                <p>You're welcome to make a team before the event. But loads of people come without a team. At the start of the event, we'll help everyone find a team. Your team members can be from other Universities. One of the best things about hackathons is meeting hackers from all over the country.</p>

                <p>A hackathon is a ~24 hour long programming event. Hundreds of passionate students come together, form teams, share ideas, and help each other build innovative applications.

                <h2>Does everyone on my team have to be from the same Uni?</h2>
                <p>Nope! In fact we encourage people to try and collaborate with people from different places and backgrounds - it often makes for more interesting hacks and is an awesome way of meeting people.</p>

                <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
                <p>A laptop is pretty much essential... Some adventurous types bring desktops although there's not nearly enough space for everyone to do that. Probably a phone charger, assorted cables and anything else for electronics you're bringing. Warm and comfortable clothes, given the amount of time you're at the event... Toiletries and a change of clothes are important too! (Also please don't bring extension leads - The power system won't be able cope with more load). There <strong>will</strong> be engineers and recruiters from a bunch of companies here as well so if you're looking for a Job or Internship you might consider touching up your CV.</p>

                <p>We are super excited to be able to have a ton of hardware available to hack on - Oculus rifts, Leap motions, Thalmic Myos, Pebble smart watches and a ton of ARM processors! We'd just ask that people don't bring soldering irons, heat guns and other power tools, as those will almost certainly soak people with the sprinkler system and we may not get invited back next year :(.</p>

                <p>Sorry, nope. We require teams that want to be eligible for prizes don't write a single line of code before the hack. This is cheating and won't go down well with the other teams - unless you don't want to compete but where's the fun in that?!</p>

Hackathons are awesome for those that hack but also a really great platform to display who you are and what you do to a bunch of students that are clearly showing they love to make cool stuff.
